**Project Description**

Build a landing page that uses JavaScript to create an interactive navigational experience.

**What will be built**

A multi-section landing page will be built. Often times, we don’t know how much content will be added to a page through a CMS or an API. To circumvent this problem, we can dynamically add the content to the page. We will be demonstrating this with the navigation menu. Additionally, dynamically building the navigation is a great precursor to understanding the virtual DOM which you will experience when you begin working with JavaScript frameworks.

To improve the user experience, the section actively being viewed should be differentiated in some way. Additionally, when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item should scroll you to the appropriate section rather than giving you the default jump.

This may not sound like a lot, but there are a fair amount of moving pieces that rely on each other to work. You’ll need to plan out the logic of what you are trying to accomplish before you begin developing. If you find this process to be quick, there’s a list of additional functionality that you can add that all strive to improve the users’ experience.

**Technologies used**

JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Interface and Architecture

**Usability**

All feature are usable across modern desktop, table and phone browsers.

**Styling** 

Styling has been added for active states.

**HTML structure**

There are at least 4 sections that have been added to the page.

## Behavior

The customized landing page has the following behavior:

**Navigation**

Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.

**Section Active State**

While scrolling through the page, the section in the viewport will be highlighted.

**Scroll to Anchor**

When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link scrolls smoothly to the appropriate section.
